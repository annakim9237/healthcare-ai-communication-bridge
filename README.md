# Digital Health AI Platform (HealthTech 2025)

A digital health prototype designed to improve continuous mental-health monitoring between therapy sessions by combining daily patient logging, clinician-facing analytics, and AI-based risk signal detection. Built for the HealthTech 2025 Competition at American University.

## Problem
Mental healthcare often lacks continuous monitoring and timely intervention between therapy sessions. This gap leads to fragmented care and delayed detection of worsening symptoms.

## Solution Overview
This project proposes a multi-component digital health system designed to bridge patient–clinician communication:

### Patient-Facing Features
- Daily logging (mood, sleep, symptoms, medication adherence)
- Reflection entry (free text)
- Quick-access support pathways (prototype)

### Clinician-Facing Features
- Dashboard with longitudinal trend visualizations  
- Patient adherence tracking  
- Risk flagging for early intervention (prototype)

### AI / Data Features (Prototype)
- Pattern detection in daily logs and reflections  
- Early-warning risk scoring  
- Rule-based and model-based triage logic  
- Prototype alerting system for clinician review

### Auxiliary Device Prototype
- Emergency Response Call Device concept for high-risk escalation

The platform aligns with **Step 5 (“Monitoring Progress & Adjustments”)** in guideline-based mental healthcare workflows.
